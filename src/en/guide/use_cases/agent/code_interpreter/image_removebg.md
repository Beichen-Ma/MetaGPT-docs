# Remove The Background of Image

## Overview
Image background removal is a technique used to separate the main objects from the background in an image. It finds applications in various fields such as image editing, person segmentation, product showcasing, and computer vision. By removing the background, it highlights the subject, enhances the visual appeal of the image, and provides a cleaner base for further processing and analysis.
## Example : 

### Task

### Code
Here is a simple code implementation for image background removal:
```python
import asyncio
from metagpt.roles.code_interpreter import CodeInterpreter

async def main(requirement: str = ""):
    code_interpreter = CodeInterpreter(use_tools=False, goal=requirement)
    await code_interpreter.run(requirement)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_path = '/data/luxiangtao/data_agents_opt-code_intepreter/dog.JPEG'    
    save_path = '/data/luxiangtao/data_agents_opt-code_intepreter/dog_rmg.png'
    requirement = (
        f"This is a image, you need to use python toolkit rembg to remove the background of the image and save the result. image path:{image_path}; save path:{save_path}."
    )
    asyncio.run(main(requirement))
```
### Output
Here is the input image of a dog and the image of the dog with the background removed. It can be seen that the background removal effect is excellent, and CodeInterpreter can smoothly accomplish this task.
